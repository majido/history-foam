Introduction
------------
An attemp to design an alternative History page for chrome using [FOAM framework](http://foam-framework.github.io/foam/).

Usage
-----
You can load this project as an unpacked extension. This extension replaces the default 
history page (`about://history`).  Here are the steps:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Check 'Developer mode' in top header
3. Click on "Load unpacked extension..." which should now be visible
4. Select the base of the project

You can also open History.html in your browser. This loads the page with a sample set of history data. 
This mode is most useful for developmenti but lack support for Favicons and removals.
