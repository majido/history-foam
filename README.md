-----
Simply open History.html in your browser. This loads the page with a sample set of history data. 
This mode is most useful for development.


It is also possible to load this project as an unpacked extension which replaces the default 
history page (`about://history`).  Here are the steps:

# Navigate to chrome://extensions
# Check 'Developer mode' in top header
# Click on "Load unpacked extension..." which should now be visible
# Select the base of the project
